# System Design: E-commerce Telegram Mini App for Food Ordering

## Implementation Approach

Based on the requirements and menu data provided, we'll design a scalable, responsive, and secure E-commerce Telegram Mini App for food ordering with the following considerations:

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS for a responsive UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: Supabase for data storage, authentication, and real-time updates
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for secure checkout
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend and backend components

### Key Implementation Challenges & Solutions

1. **Telegram Mini App Integration**:
   - Implement validation of Telegram WebApp initData for secure authentication
   - Ensure seamless integration with the Telegram interface
   - Optimize for the limited screen space of mobile devices

2. **Dynamic Menu Management**:
   - Structured menu system with categories: Main, Side, Beverages, Paste, Special Set
   - Flexible addon system for product customization (spice level, basil type, weight, packaging)

3. **Real-time Order Updates**:
   - Leverage Supabase real-time subscriptions for live order tracking
   - Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience

4. **Secure Payment Processing**:
   - Use Stripe Elements for secure payment form integration
   - Implement server-side payment confirmation

5. **Admin Panel**:
   - Create a separate interface for menu management and order processing
   - Implement permission-based access control

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system will use the following data structures and interfaces to manage the food ordering application.

### Database Schema

Using Supabase, we'll create the following tables:

1. **users** - Store user information
2. **products** - Store product information
3. **categories** - Store product categories
4. **addon_types** - Store types of addons (spice level, basil, weight, etc.)
5. **addon_options** - Store options for each addon type
6. **product_addons** - Many-to-many relationship between products and addon types
7. **orders** - Store order information
8. **order_items** - Store items in an order
9. **order_item_addons** - Store selected addons for each order item
10. **payments** - Store payment information

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Core Components**:
   - `TelegramAuthProvider` - Manages Telegram authentication
   - `ProductCatalog` - Displays products by category
   - `ProductDetail` - Shows product details with addon selection
   - `ShoppingCart` - Manages user's selected items
   - `Checkout` - Handles payment process
   - `OrderHistory` - Shows past orders and current order status
   - `AdminPanel` - Interface for administrators

2. **State Management**:
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Implement custom hooks for cart management and authentication

### Backend Architecture

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/auth` - Authentication endpoints
   - `/api/products` - Product management
   - `/api/categories` - Category management
   - `/api/addons` - Addon management
   - `/api/orders` - Order management
   - `/api/payments` - Payment processing
   - `/api/admin` - Admin endpoints

2. **Middleware**:
   - Authentication middleware
   - Error handling middleware
   - Logging middleware

## Authentication Flow

1. User opens the Telegram Mini App
2. App validates the initData from Telegram WebApp
3. Backend verifies the hash signature
4. If valid, create/retrieve user record in Supabase
5. Generate a session token for subsequent requests

## Payment Processing Flow

1. User reviews cart and proceeds to checkout
2. App loads Stripe Elements for payment details
3. User enters payment information
4. App sends payment intent to backend
5. Backend creates Stripe payment intent
6. Client confirms payment with Stripe
7. Backend verifies payment success
8. Order is marked as paid and processing begins

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Deploy React application to Vercel
   - Configure environment variables for API endpoints and Telegram bot token

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy Express API to Vercel serverless functions
   - Set up environment variables for database connection, Stripe keys, etc.

3. **Database**:
   - Configure Supabase project with appropriate tables and security rules
   - Set up real-time subscriptions for order updates

4. **CI/CD**:
   - Implement GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Configure staging and production environments

## Scalability Considerations

1. Use Vercel's edge network for global distribution
2. Implement caching for product catalog
3. Design database indexes for efficient queries
4. Consider rate limiting for API endpoints

## Security Measures

1. Validate all Telegram initData on the server
2. Implement CORS protection
3. Use HTTPS for all communications
4. Store sensitive data (like Stripe credentials) securely in environment variables
5. Input validation on all API endpoints

## Anything Unclear

1. Delivery radius or service area limitations are not specified
2. User notification preferences are not defined
3. Business hours and availability are not specified
4. Return and refund policy details are not provided
5. Multiple location support requirements are unclear
